                   A Deep Dive Into the BL Phenomenon
               </header>
               <h1>What is BL?</h1> 
               <p>Boy's Love, abbreviated to BL, is a romance genre depicting romantic and sexual relationships between two males (McLelland and Welker, 2015). Despite the genre being referred to as 'boys' love, the couples usually present a relationship from college age (16 years +) or older. To avoid confusion, the terms BL and Yaoi refer to the same genre, with the latter commonly used by fans outside of Japan (Suzuki, 2015). BL has become a global phenomenon, with McClelland (2000) reporting Japanese BL translation in English, Chinese, Portuguese, French, Italian and Spanish, with the genre itself being particularly fascinating as authors are mainly females. Consequently, BL is exceptionally popular with women, becoming prominent in mainstream media via manga publication, anime, and live-action production. Thus, there have been studies into the BL phenomena as it has become a significant manifestation of women's culture, removed from male supervision and control.</p>
               <p>Being a self-declared BL fan, I have become part of the phenomenon, encountering BL through pure coincidence as I first discovered it through a recommendation on YouTube - Sekkaiichi Hatsukoi (The World's Greatest First Love) during university. I was intrigued by the clip, leading me to watch the series's first season, which I fell in love with, resulting in me reading the manga. From here, I was instantly hooked, with reading BL becoming a regular activity I would do to help me get through university. Many people did not comprehend why I  would like this genre which caused me to reflect and analyse the aspect of BL that drew me in and why I continue to enjoy it. To best understand the allure of BL, I have broken down the history, principles and theories of BL and how this accumulated into a product that women worldwide adore while acknowledging concerns regarding the genre.</p>
           
               <h2>History</h2>
               <p>In current times, BL has become a well-accepted part of modern culture; however, the genre's history is complex, with its origin in Japan, where homosexuality still faces challenges reflected in 2023 when people are fighting against the bar on same-sex marriage2. The consumption of manga became popularised in the post-war period in Japan, where it was originally male-oriented, written by male authors who tailored their work toward teenage boys, illustrated by the launch of Shoonen Magazine in 1959 (Buckley 1991). Inevitably, manga accumulated female fans, resulting in a market targeted at teenage girls in the 1960s but still with male authors portraying themes of girls getting rescued by men. Among males, the novelist Mori Mari emerged in the 1960s, publishing novels regarding homosexual relationships between young and older men, leading her to be considered the pioneer of the BL genre. Consequently, the girls who grew up reading manga and Mori's novels inspired young girls to become writers, promoting innovative manga work from writers like Ikeda, who wrote 'Rose of Versaille' in 1972, which involved a cross-dressed girl as the love interest (McLelland, 2020). Thereby setting a precedent of a shift in romance manga in the 1970s, where more love stories involving two men began to rise, known as sh≈çnen'ai and sh≈çjo mango, which featured coming-of-age stories.</p>
           
               <p>The BL mangas became mainstream in the 1970s due to the new wave of female writers encompassing themes of searching for love, acceptance and identity, which were featured in speciality boy-love comics such as 'June' published between the late 1970s to mid-1990s (Matsui 1993). June magazine captured a cultural phenomenon with the BL manga combing aspects of tanbi culture that encompassed the pursuit of beauty in the form of beautiful male protagonists with sexual elements for entertainment purposes - signifying women's agency over the work they produced. </p>
           
               <p>Thus, Galbraith highlights the parallels between the uprise of BL and the increase of women's economic power, helping to shape a 'female-dominated' sphere of consumption, manifesting into BL manga, which most men were uninterested in or felt bewildered by the genre. In the 1980s, the term Yaoi became popularised, standing in as an acronym for 'yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi', which roughly means 'no climax, no point, no meaning', used to describe non-published BL work which began to become common. This aspect of BL culture was known for its hyperfocus on sexually explicit scenes at the expense of a good plot. From the 1990s, BL manga and light novels became more dominant in the commercial realm, with the tag BL frequently seen on book labels. Currently, in the 21st century, BL chapters and books can be purchased online and in bookstores worldwide. </p>

               <h2>BL principles and themes </h2>

               <p>A key component of the BL genre is that it follows a stylised format so that readers know what to expect when they pick up a BL book. However, to better understand how manga writers formulate a narrative, Suzuki interviewed BL creators to explore what they considered essential elements of the BL storylines. Three main principles were identified: </p>

               <h3>The Seme and Uke rule</h3>
               <p>The Seme (top) will possess qualities of being dominant and protective in the relationship and is the one who usually initiates the connection. Whereas the Uke (bottom) is the passive and receptive sexual partner, who tends to face more conflict with the relationship, characterised as being gentle. The interviews underline how the dynamic between the Seme and the Uke allows female writers the freedom to play out the sex scenes. </p>

               <h3>The happy ending</h3>
               <p>The ending is predictable, where the two male protagonists end up together. There may be a love triangle within stories, but the main couple usually overcomes obstacles and come out stronger, choosing their 'soul mate'. Therefore, entwining the concept of 'destined love' in the BL storyline through building up scenes of sexual tensions until they finally come together. Hence, the relationship is monogamous, known as the 'ichib≈ç ikketsu' (one stick, one hole) principle, and rarely includes scenes of cheating as the couple stays faithful to one another.</p>

               <h3>The sex act</h3>
               <p>Significantly, BL romances do not feature scenes of rape or humiliation, evident in male-written BLs. Although female-written BL can split into two plot lines: the Uke may be drunk or reluctant for the first time, it is a step forward to realise that they are meant to be together with the Seme. For example, if they are friends to lovers. Alternatively, the sex act is seen at the end of the story to symbolise the love they hold for each other, waiting for both to be ready. However, neither contains any unpleasant or malicious scenes, with all sexual acts driven by desire and love for each other. </p>

              <h2>So why do girls like BL?</h2> 
              <p>Ideas have manifested as to the phenomena of girls enjoying 'homosexuality, with Matsui (1993) proposing the concept of 'penis envy', derived from Freud's framework of female psychosexual development in that young girls feel concerned that they do not have a penis - therefore BL supposedly enables women to envision themselves through the Seme. However, BL's value to women has been misconstrued into something twisted. Simply put, the genre is written by women for women to enjoy rather than what men think females want to read. BL creates a world that enables escape from a misogynistic society that expects girls and women to become mothers and get married before a specific age (Fujimoto, 2007). These pressures can become daunting and restricting for young women who want to live as they please rather than satisfy societal norms. </p>

              <p>BL redirects the focus on males rather than females, alleviating the sexual objectification of women, which is normalised in society and often seen in everyday life through how the present media women, which can empower women. Thus, BL creates a universe free of strict gender norms, and females can enjoy a romance between handsome men. Thereby, BL challenges mainstream media's portrayal of men by mixing feminism and masculine features, such as the characters displaying a naturing personality usually associated with women. McLelland (2000) denotes how the relationships portrayed in BL go a step further by making the relationship equal by removing gender differential and age differences to eliminate the power hierarchy. This differs from the common trope between high school girls and teachers. Thus, it creates a story that females find endearing, which can be summarised by a woman in McLelland's (2000) report who shared that they could read BL and forget the pressure of the moment. </p>

              <p>Kinsella (1995) detected how women's interest in BL situates itself as a cute cultural phenomenon of young Japanese women - a retaliation to the sexist stereotypes that women face daily. Cute culture has manifested from the lack of good role models for young sexually active women, with two extreme ends of commercial sex workers to a housewife. Subsequently, BL represents a cute male couple with undeniable sexual content, managed in a safe environment designed by women. The explicit scenes are not there for the sake of sexual gratification, which is often the case in manga aimed at a male audience, but to empathise the bringing two people together. 
            </p>

            <p>Delving deeper into the phenomena of women reading BL is the sense of purity behind the relationship, as the partner risk being rejected by society to pursue their love. Although there are rarely scenes of homophobia, the writer subtly nods to concerns about accepting the relationship in society through the Uke's reluctance to show public affection. Subsequently, the stakes are higher and less superficial, as seen in the common trope of the handsome protagonist falling for the unpopular girl. Giddens underscores the aspect of 'pure relationships' in BL as they represent the exemplar of true romance as the relationship is encompassed by sentiments of true love and exterior support where supporting characters root for the main couple. </p>

            <p>Alternatively, Nagaike (2003) argues that explicit sex scenes in BL are the feelings of guilt and shame that women experience when consuming pornographic material due to social expectations that women should not be lewd. Women who show interest in sex can be viewed as sexually deviant and are looked down upon by society. Thereby, women project their repressed sexual interest onto homosexual relationships through consuming BL content and can enjoy sexual content with feelings of shame. Supporting this idea is how female writers incorporate feminine ideas into their male counterparts in BL.  
            </p>

            <h2>How BL can be helpful in everyday life </h2>

            <p>From taking a deep dive into BL space, it is evident why women like BL as the genre is the creation of women's imagination. It is a universe which has an expected plot which consists of handsome characters and cute moments. The main emphasis is placed upon the two being equal and that they are destined for one another, requiring them to overcome obstacles to be together. The stories are sweet and the scene feels forbidden but holds a significant purpose of two accepting each other which makes girls feel excited. For me, the world of BL is playful and exciting and is something I read to relieve myself of everyday stresses. When you open up a BL manga, there is security in knowing that the two male leads will end up together, but this doesn't take away from the moments which are heartwarming or tear-jerking. Yes, there are complicated issues with BL, as there are many genres, however, for the most part, it enables a small experience to put a smile on someone's face. The next aspect of the series will break down 4 BL books to understand how the genre can diversity and the different values they hold.
